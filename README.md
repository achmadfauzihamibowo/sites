LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee) and [many.link](https://www.google.com). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate‚Äîwe just stripped out some additional code you wouldn't need and added in branded styles for popular services.üòä

![Themes](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/themes.png)

LittleLink has more than 20 company button styles you can use and we'll be throwing more in soon. You'll also find a light and dark theme ready to go. Not a fan of the colors? Update `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css` to the HEX values of your choosing. 

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/performance.png)

Using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) let us build something that loads quickly & doesn't have any of the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity. LittleLink scored a 99/100 in performance when tested with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).
